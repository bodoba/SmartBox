# SmartBox

This is an alternative Software for the "Smart Useless Box" as it can be found [here on github](https://github.com/balassy/useless-box). The very good 3D design is [available on Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3856965).

Hardware and wiring are identical wiyth the setup [Gy√∂rgy](https://github.com/balassy) describes on [his page](https://github.com/balassy/useless-box) with the exception of the proximity sensor. Here I used the [APDS9930](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32840655108.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.5f424c4dyvvg2K).

The SW was done with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) plugin to embed the ArduinoIDE. There should be no issue running it with virgin Arduino.
